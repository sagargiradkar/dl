     print("TensorFlow version:", tf.__version__)
     ```
     - Explanation: This code checks if TensorFlow is installed correctly by printing the version.

   - **Keras Test Program**:
     ```python
     from keras import datasets
     (train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = datasets.mnist.load_data()
     print("Train images shape:", train_images.shape)
     print("Test images shape:", test_images.shape)
     ```
     - Explanation: This code loads the MNIST dataset using Keras and prints the shapes of the training and testing datasets to verify proper functionality.

   - **Theano Test Program**:
     ```python
     import numpy
     import theano.tensor as T
     from theano import function
     x = T.dscalar('x')
     y = T.dscalar('y')
     z = x + y
     f = function([x, y], z)
     print(f(5, 7))  # Output should be 12
     ```
     - Explanation: This program adds two scalar values using Theano tensors and verifies that Theano functions work correctly by outputting the sum.

   - **PyTorch Test Program**:
     ```python
     import torch
     print("PyTorch version:", torch.__version__)
     x = torch.tensor([5, 7])
     print("Tensor:", x)
     ```
     - Explanation: This code checks if PyTorch is installed correctly by printing the version and creating a simple tensor.

3. **Sequential Model in Keras**
   - **Building a Model**:
     ```python
     from keras.models import Sequential
     from keras.layers import Dense
     
     model = Sequential([
         Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
         Dense(10, activation='softmax')
     ])
     model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
     ```
     - Explanation: This code defines a basic neural network in Keras. The model uses two layers: a dense layer with ReLU activation and an output layer with softmax for classification.
   - **Training and Validation**:
     ```python
     # Assuming train_data and train_labels are available
     model.fit(train_data, train_labels, epochs=5, validation_split=0.2)
     ```
     - Explanation: This trains the model for five epochs with 20% of the data used for validation.

4. **Tensor Manipulation in PyTorch**
   ```python
   import torch
   x = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
   y = torch.tensor([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
   result = x + y
   print("Addition result:", result)
   ```
   - Explanation: This code demonstrates basic tensor addition in PyTorch, which is essential in deep learning for matrix operations.

5. **Case Study on TensorFlow**
   - **PayPal Case Study**:
     - PayPal uses TensorFlow to detect fraudulent transactions in real time. TensorFlow's ability to handle large datasets and its compatibility with GPUs allows PayPal to efficiently process and analyze transaction data, enabling them to detect and prevent fraud.
   - **Intel Case Study**:
     - Intel employs TensorFlow to optimize its hardware capabilities for AI tasks. TensorFlow’s flexibility allows Intel to design and train models that enhance hardware efficiency, especially in performance-critical applications.

### **Viva Question Answers**

1. **Basics of Deep Learning**
   - **What is deep learning?**
     - Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to automatically learn and extract features from data. It’s particularly effective for tasks like image and speech recognition due to its ability to process complex patterns in large datasets.

2. **Deep Learning Package Comparison**
   - **Why choose one package over another?**
     - TensorFlow is widely used in production and is suitable for scalable applications. PyTorch is popular in research due to its dynamic computation graph, which allows for easier debugging and flexibility. Keras, built on top of TensorFlow, is user-friendly and ideal for quick prototyping. Theano was one of the first deep learning libraries, but it's less used now due to limited support and development.

3. **Keras Ecosystem**
   - **Keras components**:
     - `Kerastuner`: For hyperparameter tuning.
     - `KerasNLP`: Specialized for natural language processing.
     - `KerasCV`: Computer vision-focused tools and models.
     - `Autokeras`: Automated machine learning library.
     - `Modeloptimization`: Optimizes models for deployment on various devices.

4. **Theano Program Explanation**
   - **Why is Theano less popular?**
     - Theano was an early pioneer in deep learning but has been largely replaced by TensorFlow and PyTorch, which offer more extensive support, better performance, and active community development.

5. **Functionality and Application Domains**
   - **Package Application Domains**:
     - TensorFlow is often used in production environments, especially for large-scale applications. PyTorch is favored in research environments. Keras is typically chosen for quick development of simpler models.

6. **Library Dependencies**
   - **Role of NumPy, SciPy, BLAS, and sklearn**:
     - NumPy is essential for mathematical operations. SciPy and BLAS provide efficient implementations of numerical routines. Sklearn is used for various machine learning tasks like data preprocessing, which complements deep learning libraries.

7. **Practical Installation Questions**
   - **Why virtual environments?**
     - Virtual environments allow you to isolate dependencies, preventing conflicts between packages or different versions required for different projects.

8. **Future of Deep Learning Libraries**
   - **Which library might become standard?**
     - PyTorch has gained popularity due to its ease of use in research, but TensorFlow’s broad application in production keeps it competitive. Both are likely to coexist, serving different needs in the industry.
